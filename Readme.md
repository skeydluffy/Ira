# HeraTemplate

## Create new Agent
Use this template to make new agents.

1. Use this template repo to start a new template.
2. Think about what the core job of the agent is, find a greek god that does that and we haven't used the name before, name it using that.
3. Link the new repo to the original Hera repo using submodules.

## Setup new agent

1. Run `./setup.sh` to setup the code and development workflow.
2. Make sure that your virtualenv (.venv) has been correctly setup.
